# Tutorial on using head-mounted eye tracking in infant research 
#### July 8, 2022 • ICIS 2022 Ottawa
####  Preconference Organizers: Chen Yu, John Franchak, & Irina Castellanos

This preconference workshop has two parts. In the first part, a tutorial will cover best practices in collecting and analyzing head-mounted eye tracking data with infant participants. After the break, the second part will consist of three talks that showcase the use of head-mounted eye tracking in infant research.
